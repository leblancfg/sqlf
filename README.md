# sqlf
An opinionated SQL linter and formatter. For now, just a toy project to learn Rust.

## Installation
Nothing to speak of at the moment, I don't know how to crate / cargo / package / binary things yet. Clone the repo and run `cargo run` to run the program.

```bash
cargo run YOUR_FILE.sql
```

But also don't, because it doesn't do anything yet. You can also run the tests with `cargo test`.
